Title: OpenLayers 3, a free and open source multi-purpose library for web mapping

OpenLayers 3 is a JavaScript based library for web mapping, published under BSD license. It groups a set of functionalities to create both lightweight web mapping applications and more heavy web mapping applications for advanced usages. It enables display of geographic features (markers, lines, polygons) with custom styles, most of the time with background maps services from various sources (including OpenStreetMap). It manages all interactions to select, draw geographic entities, display, measure geographic coordinates and manage different Earth representations using cartographic projections.
